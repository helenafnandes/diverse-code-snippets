    <!-- it's best to put the script tag as the last thing of the body
        for 2 reasons:
    1) the browser will render this html file from top to bottom.
    if you put the script tag at the head element, the browser will take
    some time to parse and execute the js and only then show the contents
    on the html page 
    2) if the script talks to any element present on the page, we will 
    make sure all elements are rendered before trying to execute the js -->

    <!-- but if you're using 3rd party code, it has to be on the
        head section -->
    <!-- <script>
        console.log('this will be shown');
    </script>
    <script src="index.js">
        // js comments! js code inside html
        console.log('this will not'); 

    </script>
    <script>
        console.log('this will also be shown');
